										<h2><a>Movie Similarity Detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and K-Means Clustering with Python</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/thumbs/movie_similarity.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this analysis, the similarity of movies was quantified based on their plot summaries available on IMDb and Wikipedia. Using tokenization, the textual data was processed to identify common themes and patterns. The movies were then grouped into clusters to reveal inherent similarities. The analysis leveraged several Python libraries, including Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, ScikitLearn, Matplotlib, and Scipy, to perform data manipulation, natural language processing, clustering, and visualization. This clustering approach offers valuable insights into how movies relate to one another based on their narratives.</p>

										<h2><a>Book's Word Frequency Analysis with BeautifulSoup, Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) and Counter.</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/thumbs/word_freq_in_book.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The Data Science pipeline developed in this notebook enables visualization of word frequency distributions for any novel available on Project Gutenberg. Utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) tools, this pipeline can handle a wide range of textual data. Given that a significant proportion of the world's data is unstructured and text-heavy, the techniques applied here are broadly applicable to many data science tasks. This approach demonstrates the power of NLP in extracting meaningful insights from large volumes of text data, which is a common challenge faced by data scientists.</p>
